         """<h1>Managing RNG: Turn Luck Into Skill</h1>
<p>Randomness is inherent to roguelike deckbuilders, but the best players minimize its impact through strategic decisions. This guide teaches you to control randomness and create consistency in an uncertain genre.</p>

<h2>Understanding RNG Types</h2>
<p>Input randomness occurs before decisions—card draws, enemy spawns, reward offerings. You respond to these random elements. Output randomness occurs after decisions—damage ranges, effect chances, critical hits. You can't control these outcomes directly.</p>

<p>Input randomness creates variety while maintaining player agency. Output randomness reduces control and increases frustration. The best deckbuilders emphasize input over output randomness.</p>

<h2>Probability Management</h2>
<p>Think in probabilities, not certainties. A 75% chance to succeed means failure one in four times. Plan for both outcomes. Build redundancy into strategies so single failures don't end runs.</p>

<p>Calculate expected value for random effects. A 50% chance for 10 damage averages 5 damage. Compare this to guaranteed alternatives. Sometimes consistency beats higher potential.</p>

</div>

<h2>Deck Consistency Techniques</h2>
<p>Smaller decks reduce draw randomness. With fewer cards, you see key cards more frequently. Remove weak cards aggressively to improve consistency.</p>

<p>Card draw mitigates randomness by providing options. More cards mean more choices and better answers. Include draw effects to smooth out bad luck.</p>

<p>Redundancy creates consistency through multiple solutions. Three different defensive cards ensure you have answers. Don't rely on single cards for critical functions.</p>

<h2>Risk Assessment Framework</h2>
<p>Evaluate risk versus reward for every decision. High-risk plays need proportional payoffs. Taking 50% success chances for minor benefits is poor risk management.</p>

<p>Consider cumulative risk across runs. Multiple 90% success chances compound into likely failure. One 90% chance succeeds nine times. Three 90% chances succeed only 73% overall.</p>

<h2>Variance Reduction Strategies</h2>
<p>Minimize high-variance cards unless building around them. Cards with random effects are inconsistent. Prefer reliable effects over potentially powerful but unreliable ones.</p>

<p>Use tutoring and card selection to find specific answers. Scrying, searching, and retention reduce randomness in draws. Control what you draw rather than hoping.</p>

<h2>Adapting to Random Events</h2>
<p>Flexibility beats rigid planning when facing randomness. Adapt strategies based on actual offerings rather than forcing predetermined builds. Work with what randomness provides.</p>

<p>Maintain multiple victory paths to hedge against bad luck. If one strategy fails due to randomness, pivot to alternatives. Never commit everything to single approaches.</p>

</div>

<h2>Psychological RNG Management</h2>
<p>Confirmation bias makes bad luck feel targeted. Humans remember negative outcomes more than positive ones. Track actual statistics to combat feeling "unlucky."</p>

<p>Avoid tilt from randomness. Bad RNG triggers emotional responses that worsen decision-making. Recognize tilt and return to systematic evaluation.</p>

<h2>Game-Specific RNG Mechanics</h2>
<p>Each deckbuilder implements randomness differently. Slay the Spire has minimal output randomness—most effects are guaranteed. Monster Train uses more random effects but provides ways to manipulate them.</p>

<p>Learn each game's specific random elements. Some games show future randomness (like Griftlands showing upcoming cards). Use this information for planning.</p>

<h2>Statistical Thinking</h2>
<p>Large sample sizes reveal true probabilities. One run isn't enough to evaluate strategies. Judge approaches across many attempts, not individual outcomes.</p>

<p>Understand regression to the mean. Extremely good or bad luck balances out over time. Don't overreact to outlier events.</p>

<h2>Building Around Randomness</h2>
<p>Some strategies embrace randomness rather than avoiding it. Chaos builds in Hades leverage random boons. High-roll strategies accept inconsistency for explosive potential.</p>

<p>If building around randomness, maximize attempts. More random triggers mean results approach expected values. Single random events are coins flips; multiple events become predictable.</p>

<h2>Information Gathering</h2>
<p>Reduce uncertainty through information. Scout ahead when possible. Learn enemy patterns and attack ranges. Knowledge reduces effective randomness.</p>

<p>Use early encounters to test strategies safely. Experiment when stakes are low. Save consistent approaches for critical battles.</p>

<h2>Hedging Strategies</h2>
<p>Hedge against bad outcomes through preparation. Keep emergency options for worst-case scenarios. One panic button can save runs from disaster.</p>

<p>Balance offensive and defensive options. Pure strategies fail when randomness doesn't cooperate. Mixed approaches handle various situations.</p>

<h2>RNG Manipulation</h2>
<p>Some games allow indirect RNG manipulation. Rerolling shops, banishing cards from pools, or influencing reward types. Use these tools to shape randomness favorably.</p>

<p>Understand seed mechanics if available. Some games use deterministic randomness where actions influence future RNG. Learn these systems for advantage.</p>

<h2>Common RNG Mistakes</h2>
<p>Blaming losses purely on luck rather than analyzing decisions. Bad luck happens, but good players win despite it. Focus on what you control.</p>

<p>Taking unnecessary risks when ahead. Solid positions don't need gambling. Preserve advantages rather than risking them for marginal gains.</p>

<p>Not respecting randomness when behind. Desperate situations might require accepting unfavorable odds. Sometimes 30% chances are your best option.</p>

<h2>The Skill in Randomness</h2>
<p>Managing randomness IS the skill in roguelikes. Perfect information games test different abilities. Uncertainty management separates great players from good ones.</p>

<p>Embrace randomness as the genre's core challenge. Without it, roguelikes become puzzles with solutions. Randomness creates infinite variety and replayability.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Controlling Chaos</h2>
<p>RNG management transforms luck into skill through strategic decisions. While individual events remain random, long-term success comes from consistently making positive expected value choices.</p>

<p>Master players don't eliminate randomness—they navigate it successfully. Build robust strategies, maintain flexibility, and make peace with uncertainty. This is the path to roguelike mastery.</p>

         """<h1>Elite Hunting: Risk vs Reward Analysis</h1>
<p>Elite encounters define roguelike deckbuilder runs. These challenging fights offer powerful rewards but threaten run-ending defeats. Mastering elite engagement decisions separates good players from great ones.</p>

<h2>Understanding Elite Value</h2>
<p>Elites provide superior rewards compared to regular encounters. Better card offerings, more gold, and guaranteed relics make them attractive targets. The power gained from successful elite hunting accelerates deck development significantly.</p>

<p>However, elites deal substantially more damage than regular enemies. They have unique mechanics, higher health, and punishing attacks. One elite fight might cost more health than three regular encounters.</p>

<h2>The Elite Decision Framework</h2>
<p>Before engaging elites, evaluate three factors: deck power level, current health, and upcoming challenges. Strong decks with high health should hunt aggressively. Weak decks with low health should avoid them.</p>

<p>Consider timing within acts. Early elites are proportionally easier but come when your deck is weakest. Late elites are harder but you're better equipped. Mid-act elites often provide the best risk-reward ratio.</p>

</div>

<h2>Act 1 Elite Strategy</h2>
<p>Act 1 elites test fundamental deck competence. You need either strong damage to race them or solid defense to outlast them. Without either, avoid Act 1 elites entirely.</p>

<p>The first elite is often the run's most important decision. Success provides a crucial power spike. Failure might end the run immediately. Evaluate honestly whether your starting cards plus early additions can handle the challenge.</p>

<h2>Deck Power Assessment</h2>
<p>Calculate your deck's damage output and defensive capability. Can you deal 100+ damage quickly? Can you block 20+ damage per turn? These benchmarks indicate elite readiness.</p>

<p>Consider your deck's scaling versus frontload. Elites favor frontloaded damage to minimize damage taken. Scaling strategies might take too much damage before coming online.</p>

<h2>Health as Resource</h2>
<p>View health as currency for buying power through elite fights. Spending 30 health for a game-changing relic might be worthwhile. But overspending leaves you vulnerable to future challenges.</p>

<p>Calculate health budgets for elite encounters. If elites typically cost 25-35 health, ensure you have sufficient reserves. Factor in healing opportunities between fights.</p>

<h2>Elite-Specific Preparation</h2>
<p>Each elite has specific counters and requirements. Some punish defensive strategies, others destroy aggressive decks. Learn elite patterns and build accordingly.</p>

<p>Path toward elites only when prepared for specific matchups. Generic "good stuff" decks often fail against elites requiring specific answers. Targeted preparation dramatically improves success rates.</p>

</div>

<h2>Relic Consideration</h2>
<p>Relics from elites can completely transform runs. Energy relics enable expensive strategies. Defensive relics provide sustainable advantage. Build-around relics create new archetypes.</p>

<p>Sometimes hunting elites for specific relics is correct even at significant health cost. Game-changing relics justify aggressive risk-taking. Evaluate whether potential rewards warrant the danger.</p>

<h2>The Snowball Effect</h2>
<p>Successful elite hunting creates positive feedback loops. Better cards and relics make future elites easier. This snowball effect can carry entire runs.</p>

<p>Conversely, avoiding all elites creates negative spirals. Without elite rewards, your deck falls behind the power curve. Eventually, even regular enemies become challenging.</p>

<h2>Path Planning Around Elites</h2>
<p>Plan paths considering elite placement and preparation needs. Route through shops before elites to buy specific answers. Hit campfires for upgrades that help with elite matchups.</p>

<p>Sometimes the best path avoids early elites to hunt later ones. Building power through regular encounters first might enable multiple elite kills later.</p>

<h2>Elite Hunting Mindset</h2>
<p>Adopt calculated aggression rather than fear or recklessness. Elites should be respected but not avoided entirely. Find the balance between cowardice and overconfidence.</p>

<p>Accept that some elite fights go poorly despite preparation. Randomness means even good decisions sometimes fail. Focus on making positive expected value choices.</p>

<h2>Recovery Planning</h2>
<p>Plan recovery after elite fights. Know where healing opportunities exist. Factor recovery time into elite engagement decisions. Taking an elite before a rest site is very different from taking one before more fights.</p>

<p>Sometimes aggressive elite hunting requires defensive pivots afterward. Use elite rewards to shore up weaknesses exposed during fights.</p>

<h2>Game-Specific Elite Strategies</h2>
<p>Each game's elites require different approaches. Slay the Spire's Act 1 elites test specific capabilities. Monster Train's elite waves demand sustained power. Learn game-specific requirements.</p>

<p>Some games telegraph elite fights, others surprise you. Adjust strategies based on information availability. Perfect information allows precise preparation; uncertainty requires general readiness.</p>

<h2>Common Elite Hunting Mistakes</h2>
<p>Fighting elites with incomplete decks hoping for lucky draws. Elite fights punish inconsistency severely. Ensure reliable strategies before engagement.</p>

<p>Taking elites when alternatives exist. Sometimes pathing around elites for other advantages is correct. Don't fight elites just because they're there.</p>

<p>Underestimating elite damage output. Players often remember elite health but forget their damage. Budget more health than expected.</p>

<h2>Advanced Elite Techniques</h2>
<p>Potion optimization for elite fights. Save powerful potions specifically for elites rather than using them on regular encounters. The power spike justifies hoarding.</p>

<p>Building with specific elites in mind from run start. If you know certain elites appear, draft cards that counter them early. Proactive preparation beats reactive adjustment.</p>

<h2>The Elite Hunting Curve</h2>
<p>Beginners avoid all elites from fear. Intermediates fight all elites from greed. Experts fight selective elites from calculation. Progress through these stages naturally.</p>

<p>Track your elite win rates to identify strengths and weaknesses. Some players excel at Act 1 elites but struggle with Act 2. Understanding your tendencies improves decision-making.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Calculated Courage</h2>
<p>Elite hunting embodies roguelike deckbuilding's risk-reward essence. These encounters test every aspect of your strategic understanding and deck construction. Master them to master the genre.</p>

<p>Perfect elite hunting balances aggression with prudence. Fight when prepared, avoid when weak, and always calculate risk versus reward. This measured approach maximizes long-term success.</p>

         """<h1>Climbing Ascension: Strategies for High Difficulty</h1>
<p>Ascension modes and similar difficulty systems extend roguelike deckbuilders far beyond initial completion. These increasingly challenging modes test mastery through cumulative difficulty modifiers. This guide provides strategies for conquering the highest difficulties.</p>

<h2>Understanding Difficulty Scaling</h2>
<p>Ascension modes typically add specific modifiers rather than simply increasing numbers. Enemies might gain more health, elites appear more frequently, or healing becomes less effective. Each modifier requires strategic adaptation, not just better play.</p>

<p>Cumulative difficulty means each level builds on previous ones. Ascension 10 includes all modifiers from Ascensions 1-9. This compounding challenge requires increasingly refined strategies.</p>

<h2>The Ascension Mindset Shift</h2>
<p>Low ascension allows experimental builds and fun strategies. High ascension demands optimization and consistency. Shift from "what's fun" to "what wins" as difficulty increases.</p>

<p>Accept that win rates decrease at higher difficulties. Professional players might maintain 50% win rates at maximum difficulty. Adjust expectations and celebrate every victory.</p>

<h2>Fundamentals Become Critical</h2>
<p>High ascension punishes fundamental mistakes severely. Poor energy management, bad pathing, or weak card evaluation that barely matters at low difficulty becomes run-ending at high levels.</p>

<p>Master basics before attempting high ascension. Perfect your understanding of energy curves, card evaluation, and damage calculations. Advanced strategies mean nothing without solid fundamentals.</p>

<h2>Consistency Over Power Ceiling</h2>
<p>High ascension favors consistent strategies over potentially powerful but unreliable ones. A deck that performs adequately every fight beats one that sometimes dominates but sometimes fails.</p>

<p>Build redundancy into strategies. Multiple defensive options, various damage sources, and flexible game plans handle ascension's increased challenge variety.</p>

<h2>Resource Management Intensifies</h2>
<p>Every resource becomes more precious at high ascension. Health is scarcer due to increased enemy damage. Gold matters more with higher shop prices. Even time becomes resource as enemies scale faster.</p>

<p>Calculate resource efficiency constantly. Is this upgrade worth a rest? Should you buy this card or save for relics? Resource optimization separates high ascension success from failure.</p>

<h2>Adaptation to Specific Modifiers</h2>
<p>Each ascension level's modifier requires specific adaptations. If enemies have more health, prioritize scaling damage. If healing is reduced, focus on damage mitigation over recovery.</p>

<p>Study modifier breakpoints that fundamentally change strategy. Some modifiers barely affect gameplay while others require complete strategic overhauls. Recognize which levels demand new approaches.</p>

</div>

<h2>Deck Velocity Becomes Essential</h2>
<p>High ascension rewards fast decks that cycle quickly. Seeing key cards more frequently improves consistency against increased threats. Aggressive deck thinning becomes mandatory.</p>

<p>Remove weak cards religiously. Every strike or defend diluting your deck costs percentage points of win rate. Prioritize removal even over powerful additions.</p>

<h2>Win Condition Clarity</h2>
<p>High ascension decks need clear, executable win conditions. Vague "good stuff" piles fail against optimized challenges. Identify your victory path early and commit fully.</p>

<p>Common win conditions include infinite combos, massive scaling, or extreme defense. Choose based on character strengths and card offerings, but choose decisively.</p>

<h2>Elite Management Evolution</h2>
<p>Elite fights become increasingly dangerous but remain necessary for power gains. The risk-reward calculation shifts at each ascension level. Learn new thresholds for elite engagement.</p>

<p>Some ascension levels make elites nearly mandatory due to increased regular enemy difficulty. Others make elites so dangerous that avoidance becomes correct. Adapt to each level's balance.</p>

<h2>Path Optimization</h2>
<p>Perfect pathing becomes crucial at high ascension. Every node must provide value. Minimize damage taken while maximizing power gained. This requires deep knowledge of encounter possibilities.</p>

<p>Plan entire acts from the beginning. Work backward from act bosses to determine required power levels. Route through necessary resources to achieve these benchmarks.</p>

<h2>Game Knowledge Requirements</h2>
<p>High ascension demands encyclopedic game knowledge. Know every enemy's attack patterns, every card's interactions, and every relic's impact. Information advantage translates directly to win rate.</p>

<p>Study damage calculations, enemy AI patterns, and event probabilities. The more you know, the better you can optimize decisions. Knowledge eliminates uncertainty from the difficulty equation.</p>

<h2>Psychological Challenges</h2>
<p>High ascension creates unique mental pressures. Consecutive losses trigger tilt. The gap between your best and the required level frustrates. Manage these psychological challenges alongside strategic ones.</p>

<p>Take breaks after difficult losses. Analyze defeats objectively rather than emotionally. Remember that even optimal play loses sometimes at high difficulty.</p>

<h2>Learning from Better Players</h2>
<p>Watch high-level players tackle maximum difficulty. Note not just their choices but their reasoning. Understanding why experts make specific decisions teaches more than copying strategies.</p>

<p>Join communities focused on high-level play. Discuss strategies, share discoveries, and learn from collective knowledge. The community's combined experience exceeds any individual's.</p>

<h2>Incremental Progression</h2>
<p>Climb ascension levels gradually. Each level teaches lessons needed for the next. Jumping to maximum difficulty immediately prevents proper learning progression.</p>

<p>Master each level before advancing. Consistent success at one level indicates readiness for the next. Rushing through ascension levels creates knowledge gaps that compound.</p>

<h2>Character and Strategy Mastery</h2>
<p>High ascension often requires character specialization. Master one character completely rather than playing all characters adequately. Deep knowledge of specific interactions matters more than variety.</p>

<p>Develop go-to strategies for each character. While adaptation remains important, having reliable templates for success improves consistency. Know which cards and relics enable your character's best strategies.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: The Summit Awaits</h2>
<p>Climbing ascension represents roguelike deckbuilding's ultimate challenge. Each level demands better understanding, tighter play, and optimized strategies. The journey from Ascension 0 to maximum difficulty transforms players from casual enthusiasts to strategic masters.</p>

<p>Success requires patience, study, and persistent improvement. Every loss teaches valuable lessons. Every victory proves growing mastery. Embrace the challenge and enjoy the climb.</p>

         """<h1>Card Upgrade Priority: What to Enhance First</h1>
<p>Upgrades significantly impact deck power in roguelike deckbuilders. Choosing which cards to enhance and when can determine run success. This guide teaches optimal upgrade prioritization for maximum impact.</p>

<h2>Frequency of Use Principle</h2>
<p>Upgrade cards you play every fight first. A frequently-used mediocre card benefits more from upgrading than a rarely-used powerful card. If you play a card every turn, upgrading it affects every turn.</p>

<p>Track mental statistics on card usage. Which cards consistently leave your hand? Which sit unplayed? Upgrade the workers, not the specialists, for consistent improvement.</p>

<h2>Multiplicative vs Additive Upgrades</h2>
<p>Some upgrades multiply effectiveness while others add incrementally. A card going from "deal damage to ALL enemies" to "deal MORE damage to all enemies" multiplies value. Prioritize multiplicative upgrades.</p>

<p>Cost reduction upgrades often provide multiplication through enabling more plays. A card dropping from 2 to 1 energy doesn't just save energy—it enables combinations previously impossible.</p>

</div>

<h2>Early vs Late Game Upgrades</h2>
<p>Early upgrades provide value across entire runs. An Act 1 upgrade affects dozens of fights. An Act 3 upgrade affects only a few. Prioritize early upgrades for maximum total value.</p>

<p>However, late-game upgrades can enable specific strategies for final bosses. If an upgrade transforms your win condition, timing matters less than impact.</p>

<h2>Bottleneck Identification</h2>
<p>Identify what limits your deck's performance. If you lack damage, upgrade offensive cards. If you take too much damage, upgrade defensive cards. Fix weaknesses before enhancing strengths.</p>

<p>Sometimes bottlenecks aren't obvious. Draw problems might limit everything else. Energy constraints might prevent playing good cards. Upgrade cards that remove bottlenecks.</p>

<h2>Transformative Upgrades</h2>
<p>Some upgrades fundamentally change cards rather than improving numbers. These transformative upgrades often provide the most value. A card gaining "retain" or "exhaust" might enable entirely new strategies.</p>

<p>Learn which upgrades are transformative for each card. This knowledge lets you recognize high-priority upgrades immediately. Sometimes a specific upgrade justifies taking an otherwise weak card.</p>

<h2>Scaling Enhancement</h2>
<p>Cards that scale benefit enormously from upgrades. If a card gains +2 strength per play, upgrading to +3 represents 50% improvement that compounds every use. Scaling upgrades provide exponential value.</p>

<p>Identify your deck's scaling engines and upgrade them aggressively. These cards define your late-game power level. Even small improvements to scaling create massive differences.</p>

<h2>Defensive Upgrade Value</h2>
<p>Defensive upgrades prevent more damage than healing recovers. Upgrading a block card from 5 to 8 prevents 3 damage every use. Over many fights, this prevents massive cumulative damage.</p>

<p>Prioritize defensive upgrades when survival is questionable. It's better to win slowly than lose quickly. Ensure survivability before maximizing offense.</p>

<h2>Combo Piece Priority</h2>
<p>Cards enabling combos deserve high upgrade priority. If your strategy requires specific cards working together, upgrade all pieces. A combo is only as strong as its weakest component.</p>

<p>Consider upgrade order within combos. Sometimes upgrading setup cards first enables the combo sooner. Other times, upgrading payoff cards maximizes combo impact.</p>

<h2>Energy Efficiency Upgrades</h2>
<p>Upgrades improving energy efficiency provide action economy. A card dealing 50% more damage for the same cost is effectively gaining energy value. These upgrades enable doing more with limited resources.</p>

<p>Calculate damage-per-energy or block-per-energy to identify efficiency upgrades. Even small efficiency improvements compound across many plays.</p>

<h2>Situational vs Universal Upgrades</h2>
<p>Universal upgrades benefit in all situations. More damage always helps. More block always helps. Prioritize universal upgrades over situational ones unless building specific strategies.</p>

<p>Situational upgrades might provide massive value in specific circumstances. If you face many multi-enemy fights, area damage upgrades become universal for your run.</p>

<h2>The Upgrade Economy</h2>
<p>View upgrades as investments with returns over time. Early investments compound more than late ones. High-frequency cards provide more return opportunities. Calculate expected value across remaining fights.</p>

<p>Sometimes saving upgrade opportunities for future cards is correct. If you expect to find better cards soon, patience might yield better returns.</p>

<h2>Game-Specific Upgrade Systems</h2>
<p>Each game implements upgrades differently. Slay the Spire has single upgrade levels with predetermined effects. Monster Train allows multiple upgrades with choices. Learn each system's specific optimization strategies.</p>

<p>Some games make upgrades permanent, others temporary. Permanent upgrades deserve more consideration. Temporary upgrades can be more experimental.</p>

<h2>Common Upgrade Mistakes</h2>
<p>Upgrading cards you want to be good rather than cards that are good. Wishful thinking doesn't improve cards. Upgrade cards that actually contribute to victory.</p>

<p>Spreading upgrades too thin. Five partially upgraded cards often underperform two fully upgraded cards. Focus upgrades for maximum impact.</p>

<p>Ignoring boring but effective upgrades. +2 damage seems less exciting than new effects, but consistent improvements win runs.</p>

<h2>Tracking Upgrade Impact</h2>
<p>Pay attention to how upgrades affect fights. Did that defensive upgrade save you? Did that damage upgrade speed up victories? Learning upgrade impact improves future prioritization.</p>

<p>Some upgrades provide hidden value through enabling other plays. An energy cost reduction might not directly win fights but enables game-winning combinations.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Strategic Enhancement</h2>
<p>Optimal upgrade prioritization significantly impacts run success. The difference between random and strategic upgrading might be 20% win rate. This knowledge transforms adequate players into consistent winners.</p>

<p>Master upgrade priority through conscious practice. Before each upgrade, consider all options and reasoning. This deliberate approach develops intuition for maximum impact enhancement.</p>

         """<h1>Path Planning Mastery: Navigating Act Maps</h1>
<p>Path planning separates strategic players from those who click randomly through nodes. Optimal routing through acts provides the resources and encounters needed for victory. This guide teaches advanced path planning techniques.</p>

<h2>Reading the Map</h2>
<p>Study the entire act map before choosing any path. Identify key nodes like elites, shops, and campfires. Note path convergences and divergences. This overview informs all routing decisions.</p>

<p>Count node types along potential paths. A path with three campfires differs greatly from one with three elites. Quantify options to make informed comparisons.</p>

<h2>Working Backward from Goals</h2>
<p>Identify what your deck needs to succeed, then route toward those resources. Need card removal? Path through shops. Need upgrades? Prioritize campfires. Let requirements drive routing.</p>

<p>Consider boss requirements and work backward. If the act boss punishes weak defense, ensure your path provides defensive options. Anticipate needs and route accordingly.</p>

<h2>The Campfire Decision</h2>
<p>Campfires offer the choice between healing and upgrading. Plan which you'll need at each campfire before routing. A path with campfires is only valuable if you can use them effectively.</p>

<p>Sometimes upgrading at low health is correct if future nodes provide healing. Other times, healing is mandatory for survival. Anticipate campfire decisions during planning.</p>

<h2>Shop Timing and Preparation</h2>
<p>Shops require gold to provide value. Routing through shops without gold wastes opportunities. Plan gold accumulation before shop visits. Time shops for when you'll have purchasing power.</p>

<p>Consider what shops might offer and whether you want it. Early shops provide attack cards and removal. Late shops offer expensive powers and relics. Route based on expected offerings.</p>

<h2>Elite Positioning</h2>
<p>Elite placement dramatically affects path value. Elites immediately after campfires allow upgrading for the fight. Elites before campfires let you heal afterward. Position matters as much as quantity.</p>

<p>Some paths force multiple elites. Evaluate whether your deck can handle consecutive elite fights. The rewards might not justify the risk.</p>

<h2>Question Mark Psychology</h2>
<p>Unknown events create planning uncertainty. They might provide powerful benefits or unfortunate penalties. Risk-tolerant players favor question marks; risk-averse players avoid them.</p>

<p>Learn event pools for each act. Knowing possible outcomes improves evaluation. Some acts have mostly beneficial events; others contain many penalties. Use this knowledge in routing.</p>

<h2>Path Length Considerations</h2>
<p>Longer paths provide more resources but also more damage. Short paths preserve health but limit power growth. Balance path length with deck needs and health resources.</p>

<p>Sometimes the shortest path is correct when you're already powerful. Other times, long paths are necessary for adequate preparation. Evaluate based on current strength versus required strength.</p>

<h2>Flexibility and Adaptation</h2>
<p>Initial path planning should be flexible. Card rewards might change your needs. Events might provide unexpected resources. Maintain backup routes for when plans change.</p>

<p>Re-evaluate paths after significant changes. A powerful rare card might enable elite hunting. A cursed relic might require defensive routing. Adapt to new circumstances.</p>

<h2>Act-Specific Strategies</h2>
<p>Each act requires different routing priorities. Act 1 focuses on deck foundation and surviving elites. Act 2 emphasizes scaling and preparation. Act 3 demands boss-specific preparation.</p>

<p>Learn act-specific encounter pools and difficulties. Some acts punish aggressive routing while others reward it. Adjust strategies based on act characteristics.</p>

<h2>Resource Budgeting</h2>
<p>Plan resource expenditure across entire acts. If you'll need 100 gold for crucial shop purchases, ensure your path generates it. If you need three upgrades, route through sufficient campfires.</p>

<p>Consider resource opportunity costs. Gold spent on card removal can't buy relics. Campfires used for healing can't provide upgrades. Budget resources like any strategic game.</p>

<h2>Information Gathering Routes</h2>
<p>Early paths should provide information about your deck's direction. Fight variety helps identify weaknesses. Events might provide build-defining rewards. Route for maximum learning early.</p>

<p>Later paths should exploit gathered information. Once you know your strategy, route for specific support. Information gathering transitions to execution.</p>

<h2>Common Pathing Mistakes</h2>
<p>Following the same path patterns regardless of deck needs. Every run requires unique routing based on specific circumstances. Avoid autopilot pathing.</p>

<p>Overvaluing or undervaluing specific node types. Shops aren't always good. Elites aren't always bad. Context determines node value.</p>

<p>Not planning beyond the current act. Future acts affect current routing. Save resources for later challenges when appropriate.</p>

<h2>Advanced Pathing Techniques</h2>
<p>Path convergence manipulation involves choosing routes that maintain multiple options longest. This preserves flexibility for adaptation.</p>

<p>Node counting optimizes specific resources. If you need exactly two campfires and one shop, find the path providing exactly that. Precision routing prevents waste.</p>

<h2>The Perfect Path Myth</h2>
<p>No perfect path exists for all situations. Good pathing adapts to specific needs and circumstances. Focus on making reasonable decisions with available information.</p>

<p>Even optimal pathing can't guarantee success. Randomness affects outcomes regardless of planning. Good pathing improves probabilities, not certainties.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: The Journey Matters</h2>
<p>Path planning transforms random wandering into strategic progression. Every node choice affects run trajectory. Mastering path planning provides consistent advantages that compound throughout runs.</p>

<p>Develop pathing skills through conscious practice. Before choosing paths, articulate reasoning. Review whether paths provided expected value. This deliberate approach builds intuition.</p>
