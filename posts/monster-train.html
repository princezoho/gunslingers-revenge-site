            <h2>A Roguelike on Rails</h2>
            <p><em>Monster Train</em> is a 2020 roguelike deck‑building game developed by Shiny Shoe and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment. Released in May 2020 for Windows and later for consoles and iOS, the game takes place on a runaway train to hell where you must protect a burning pyre from invading forces. Battles occur across multiple vertical floors, and you play cards to summon monsters and cast spells【437902021328268†L146-L170】.</p>
            <p>With five clans to mix and match, dozens of cards and artifacts, and procedurally generated runs, Monster Train offers deep strategy and replayability. The game earned positive reviews and received award nominations for its innovative mechanics and addictive gameplay【437902021328268†L146-L170】.</p>
            <h2>What Sets It Apart</h2>
            <p>The vertical combat lanes create interesting positional puzzles. You must decide which floors to defend, when to upgrade your pyre and how to combine clan abilities for powerful synergies. The fast‑paced battles and meaningful choices make each run a blast. Whether you’re a fan of roguelikes or card games, <em>Monster Train</em> deserves a spot on your playlist.</p>

            <h2>Clans, Challenges and Mod Support</h2>
            <p>Five clans – Hellhorned, Awoken, Stygian Guard, Umbra and Melting Remnant – each offer distinct playstyles. You’ll select two clans for every run, mixing their cards and mechanics to discover potent combos. Post‑launch updates added a sixth clan and numerous balance tweaks, while the Last Divinity DLC introduces a multi‑phase super‑boss and new cards. Steam Workshop integration lets modders add custom clans, cards and mechanics, ensuring the train keeps rolling for years to come.</p>
