            <h1>Essential Deckbuilding Tips for Beginners</h1>
            
            <p>Roguelike deckbuilders can seem overwhelming at first. Random cards, complex synergies, and permadeath create a steep learning curve. These fundamental tips will accelerate your journey from novice to expert.</p>

            <h2>1. Smaller Decks Win More</h2>
            <p>New players often grab every card offered. This is a mistake. A focused 15-card deck beats a bloated 40-card deck every time. Why? Probability. In a smaller deck, you draw your best cards more frequently.</p>

            <p>Learn to skip card rewards. If a card doesn't directly support your strategy, leave it behind. Remove weak starter cards whenever possible. Quality beats quantity in deckbuilding.</p>

            <h2>2. Build Around a Core Strategy</h2>
            <p>Successful decks focus on one or two synergies. Maybe you're building poison damage. Perhaps you're stacking defensive buffs. Whatever your strategy, commit to it fully.</p>

            <p>Avoid the "good stuff" trap. A deck full of individually powerful cards often loses to a deck with weaker cards that work together. Synergy multiplies power exponentially.</p>

            <h2>3. Understand Action Economy</h2>
            <p>Cards that draw cards are usually excellent. Cards that generate energy enable bigger turns. Cards that play other cards create explosive combos. These "engine" pieces make decks function.</p>

            <p>Prioritize cards that do multiple things. A card that deals damage AND draws a card is worth two single-purpose cards. Efficiency wins games.</p>

            <h2>4. Know Your Enemies</h2>
            <p>Deckbuilders aren't just about your deck – they're about what you're facing. Building pure damage fails against high-health bosses. Pure defense fails against scaling enemies.</p>

            <p>Adapt your strategy based on upcoming challenges. If you know a boss blocks attacks, grab cards that apply debuffs. If enemies attack multiple times, prioritize armor over healing.</p>

            <h2>5. Resource Management Matters</h2>
            <p>Don't spend gold immediately. Save for powerful relics or key card removals. That expensive rare in the shop might be worth skipping three common cards.</p>

            <p>Health is a resource too. Taking damage to reach an elite fight's rewards often pays off. Learn when to trade health for progress.</p>

            <h2>6. Path Planning Wins Runs</h2>
            <p>Your route through the map matters as much as your card choices. Balance fights for cards, elites for relics, shops for improvements, and rest sites for healing.</p>

            <p>Early acts should focus on improving your deck. Later acts require more rest sites. Plan your path with your deck's current needs in mind.</p>

            <h2>7. Learn Card Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Not all cards scale equally. A card dealing 5 damage for 1 energy seems fine early but becomes worthless late. Cards with percentage-based effects or multipliers scale better.</p>

            <p>Evaluate cards based on the entire run, not just your current fight. That defensive card might seem unnecessary now but could save you against the final boss.</p>

            <h2>8. Relics Shape Strategies</h2>
            <p>Relics (or artifacts) often define runs more than cards. A relic that triggers on every third attack makes you prioritize cheap attacks. One that rewards playing powers changes your entire gameplan.</p>

            <p>Sometimes picking relics that synergize with each other matters more than individual power. Build your collection thoughtfully.</p>

            <h2>9. Risk vs. Reward Calculations</h2>
            <p>Deckbuilders constantly present risk/reward decisions. Should you fight that elite? Take that cursed relic? Add that powerful but expensive card?</p>

            <p>Calculate risks based on your current position. If you're strong, take risks for bigger rewards. If you're struggling, play conservatively to survive.</p>

            <h2>10. Learn From Failure</h2>
            <p>Every loss teaches something. Did you lack damage? Defense? Card draw? Identify what killed you and adjust next run.</p>

            <p>Don't blame RNG immediately. While luck matters, most losses stem from player decisions. Focus on what you could control.</p>

            <h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
            <p>Deckbuilders reward pattern recognition. The more you play, the faster you'll spot synergies and evaluate cards. Don't get discouraged by early losses – they're part of learning.</p>

            <p>Start with one character or class until you master it. Jumping between options prevents deep understanding. Expertise beats variety when learning.</p>
