            <h2>Roguelike Deck‑Building Pioneer</h2>
            <p><em>Slay the Spire</em> is a 2019 roguelike deck‑building game developed by Mega Crit. It entered early access in 2017 and officially released in 2019, inspiring countless imitators and popularising the genre【546231779729835†L161-L179】. Players choose a hero and ascend a procedurally generated tower, battling enemies and bosses with a card‑based combat system that rewards careful deck construction.</p>
            <p>Each run offers different cards and relics, encouraging experimentation. The game’s minimalist art and tight balance keep runs engaging, while its modding community and daily challenges provide endless replay value. A sequel is currently planned for 2025【546231779729835†L161-L179】.</p>
            <h2>Why It Resonates</h2>
            <p><em>Slay the Spire</em> succeeds by blending strategy and unpredictability. Because you must draft cards as you climb, the game teaches you to adapt—there are no guaranteed builds, only smart decisions and risk management. This structure makes every run feel distinct and fuels that “just one more try” loop.</p>
