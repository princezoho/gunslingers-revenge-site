            <h1>Griftlands: Where Words Cut Deeper Than Swords</h1>
            
            <p>Klei Entertainment's Griftlands asks a revolutionary question: what if you could talk your way out of fights in a roguelike? By giving negotiation equal weight to combat, this deckbuilder creates something truly special.</p>

            <h2>Two Decks, Twice the Strategy</h2>
            <p>Griftlands' genius lies in its dual-deck system. You maintain separate decks for combat and negotiation, each with distinct mechanics. Combat feels familiar – deal damage, apply debuffs, survive. Negotiation plays like psychological warfare, where you attack arguments rather than health.</p>

            <p>The negotiation system deserves particular praise. You're not just selecting dialogue options – you're playing cards to establish dominance, exploit weaknesses, and manipulate opinions. Winning arguments feels as satisfying as winning fights.</p>

            <h2>Story That Matters</h2>
            <p>Unlike many roguelikes, Griftlands weaves narrative throughout gameplay. Your choices create ripple effects – spare an enemy, and they might help later. Kill someone's friend, and face consequences down the line. The game remembers everything.</p>

            <p>Three playable characters offer completely different stories. Sal seeks revenge in the criminal underworld. Rook navigates military politics. Smith just wants to drink and fight. Each campaign feels distinct, with unique mechanics matching their personalities.</p>

            <h2>The Havaria Setting</h2>
            <p>The world of Havaria oozes personality. This isn't generic fantasy – it's a gritty frontier where alien biology meets frontier justice. The art style perfectly captures this broken world, with character designs that tell stories before anyone speaks.</p>

            <p>Day/night cycles affect available activities. Bars open at night for drinking and brawling. Markets bustle during the day. This temporal element adds strategic depth to route planning.</p>

            <h2>Relationship Management</h2>
            <p>Every NPC remembers how you treat them. Build friendships for combat bonuses and shop discounts. Make enemies who'll actively work against you. This persistent relationship system transforms random encounters into meaningful interactions.</p>

            <p>The game tracks not just like/dislike but specific grievances. That merchant remembers you killed their bodyguard. The bartender appreciates that you defended their establishment. These details create emergent storytelling moments.</p>

            <h2>Grafts and Mutations</h2>
            <p>Beyond cards, you'll collect grafts – permanent modifications that fundamentally alter gameplay. Neural implants might boost negotiation. Combat grafts add new abilities. These create build diversity beyond deck construction.</p>

            <p>The mutation system for cards adds another customization layer. Upgrade cards through use, choosing between different evolution paths. Your favorite cards become increasingly powerful and personalized.</p>

            <h2>Prestige Levels</h2>
            <p>After completing campaigns, prestige levels add modifiers that increase difficulty while unlocking new cards and story elements. These aren't just number increases – they fundamentally change how you approach runs.</p>

            <p>The daily challenges provide focused experiences with preset decks and special rules. These bite-sized runs perfect the "one more game" formula.</p>

            <h2>Technical Considerations</h2>
            <p>Griftlands runs smoothly on most systems, though loading times between areas can drag. The UI presents information clearly, though the amount of text during negotiations might overwhelm newcomers.</p>

            <p>The game lacks mid-run saves, which can frustrate players with limited time. Runs typically last 3-4 hours, demanding significant time commitment.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Griftlands achieves something rare – genuine innovation in the roguelike deckbuilder genre. The negotiation system alone would make it noteworthy, but combined with meaningful choices and persistent consequences, it becomes essential.</p>

            <p>For players seeking narrative depth alongside strategic gameplay, Griftlands delivers. It proves that roguelikes can tell compelling stories without sacrificing replayability.</p>

            <p><strong>Score: 9/10</strong></p>
