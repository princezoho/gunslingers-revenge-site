            <h2>A Poker‑Fueled Roguelike</h2>
            <p><em>Balatro</em> is a 2024 poker‑themed roguelike deck‑building game developed by LocalThunk and published by Playstack. Released on 20 February 2024 across multiple platforms, it challenges players to score points by playing poker hands from a 52‑card deck. You have a limited number of hands and discards each round, so every play matters【709007509446507†L185-L192】.</p>
            <p>The twist comes from the wild Joker cards and modifiers that can drastically alter your strategy. You’ll weigh risk versus reward as you decide whether to hold onto a promising hand or press your luck for a better payout. Balatro’s combination of familiar card combinations and roguelike structure makes it both accessible and deeply replayable.</p>
            <h2>Press Your Luck</h2>
            <p>The game excels at making you feel like a card sharp. Each run presents new jokers and power‑ups that encourage experimentation. Clever combos can multiply your score, but a busted hand might end your streak. With its bold art style and snappy gameplay, <em>Balatro</em> brings fresh energy to the deck‑building genre.</p>

            <h2>Modes and Replayability</h2>
            <p>Balatro offers a variety of modes beyond the main run, including daily challenges with unique modifiers and high‑score leaderboards. Unlockable jokers and tarot cards ensure that your card pool evolves over time, encouraging repeated plays. It’s a perfect fit for short sessions or marathon runs, depending on how deep you want to dive.</p>
