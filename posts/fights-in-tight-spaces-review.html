            <h1>Fights in Tight Spaces: John Wick Meets Slay the Spire</h1>
            
            <p>Imagine choreographing action movie fight scenes with cards. That's Fights in Tight Spaces – a roguelike deckbuilder where positioning matters as much as your deck. The result? One of the most innovative takes on the genre.</p>

            <h2>Action Movie Magic</h2>
            <p>Every battle in Fights in Tight Spaces feels ripped from an action film. You're surrounded in a bathroom stall. Enemies rush down narrow corridors. The environment becomes your weapon as you kick foes into walls or through windows.</p>

            <p>The replay system seals the deal. After each fight, watch your card choices play out as a smooth action sequence. Suddenly your tactical decisions become cinematic moments worthy of Hollywood.</p>

            <h2>Position Is Everything</h2>
            <p>Unlike traditional deckbuilders, where you stand doesn't matter here. Every card moves you – forward strikes, backward dodges, lateral shifts. Managing space becomes as crucial as managing resources.</p>

            <p>Environmental kills reward clever positioning. Why waste cards on damage when you can push enemies off ledges? The game constantly rewards creative solutions over brute force.</p>

            <div class="cta-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #DC2626 0%, #991B1B 100%); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">

            <h2>Deck Archetypes</h2>
            <p>Different fighting styles create distinct experiences. Counter-attackers wait for enemies to strike. Aggressive brawlers rush forward. Tricksters manipulate positioning. Each style demands different strategies.</p>

            <p>The combo system adds depth. Chain cards together for momentum bonuses. Land consecutive hits to build combo meters. These systems reward planning over random card play.</p>

            <h2>Visual Style Excellence</h2>
            <p>The minimalist aesthetic works perfectly. Clean lines and stark colors ensure you always understand the battlefield. Enemy intentions display clearly. Your options remain obvious despite the complexity.</p>

            <p>Animation quality impresses throughout. Every strike has weight. Every dodge flows smoothly. The game sells the fantasy of being an action hero through visual feedback alone.</p>

            <h2>Enemy Variety</h2>
            <p>Opponents range from basic thugs to trained assassins. Each enemy type requires different approaches. Bikers charge recklessly. Snipers attack from range. Riot police block frontal assaults.</p>

            <p>Boss fights escalate the challenge. These multi-phase encounters test everything you've learned. The prison riot boss throwing waves of inmates while you manage limited space remains memorable.</p>

            <h2>Progression Systems</h2>
            <p>Between missions, upgrade your character with new cards and abilities. The medical bay heals injuries. The gym provides permanent stat boosts. These choices affect your entire run.</p>

            <p>Card evolution adds customization. Basic punches become devastating haymakers. Simple movements gain additional effects. Your deck grows stronger while maintaining its core identity.</p>

            <h2>Difficulty Options</h2>
            <p>Multiple difficulty levels cater to different players. Easy mode forgives mistakes. Normal provides balanced challenge. Hard mode demands perfection. The game scales well across skill levels.</p>

            <p>Daily challenges add variety with unique modifiers and preset decks. These focused experiences highlight different strategies and keep the game fresh.</p>

            <h2>Technical Performance</h2>
            <p>The game runs smoothly on modest hardware. Load times stay minimal. Controls respond instantly. These technical achievements ensure nothing interferes with the action.</p>

            <p>The sound design deserves praise. Every impact sounds brutal. The electronic soundtrack pumps adrenaline. Audio cues help track off-screen enemies.</p>

            <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
            <p>Content variety could be better. After several runs, scenarios start repeating. More environment types and enemy combinations would extend longevity.</p>

            <p>The tutorial could better explain advanced mechanics. New players might miss crucial strategies without external guides. The game doesn't always teach its depths.</p>

            <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
            <p>Fights in Tight Spaces successfully merges deckbuilding with spatial combat. The concept executes brilliantly, creating something genuinely new in a crowded genre. For players seeking innovation, this delivers.</p>

            <p><strong>Score: 8.5/10</strong></p>
