            <h2>Adapting a Tabletop Classic</h2>
            <p><em>Star Realms</em> is a science‑fiction deck‑building card game designed by Rob Dougherty and Darwin Kastle. In the tabletop version, players use trade points to buy cards and combat points to attack opponents in a future where factions battle for resources【312421114611384†L146-L153】. The digital adaptation faithfully recreates these mechanics on smartphones and PCs, providing asynchronous multiplayer, AI opponents and a growing collection of expansions.</p>
            <p>Games are fast and tactical: you start with a basic deck of Scouts and Vipers, then purchase more powerful ships and bases to outgun your foes. Aligning with factions like Blob, Star Empire, Machine Cult and Trade Federation enables combo effects that snowball your power. The digital version includes a single‑player campaign and online matches with friends or ranked competitors.</p>
            <h2>Why It Works Digitally</h2>
            <p>By handling shuffling, scoring and card effects automatically, the app lets you focus on strategy. The interface is clean and intuitive, and cross‑platform play means you can pick up a game on mobile and continue on PC. For fans of quick yet deep deck‑building battles, <em>Star Realms Digital</em> is an excellent way to scratch the cosmic card‑game itch.</p>
