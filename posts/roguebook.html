            <h2>Trapped in a Living Book</h2>
            <p><em>Roguebook</em> is a 2021 roguelike deck‑building game by Abrakam Entertainment, published by Nacon. Released for PC in June 2021 and for consoles in 2022, it places you inside a magical book that sucks everything into its pages【828345141694736†L149-L167】. You explore an isometric overworld by revealing tiles with ink and brushes, searching for treasures, battles and events.</p>
            <p>Combat is turn‑based and focuses on combining the decks of two characters simultaneously【828345141694736†L149-L167】. You enhance cards with gems, unlock new cards and artefacts and gradually open more of the world with each run. Roguebook’s colourful art and cooperative mechanics make it a standout within the genre.</p>
            <h2>Ink, Brushes and Strategy</h2>
            <p>The exploration layer sets Roguebook apart. Every run is a puzzle of deciding where to spend ink, which paths to uncover and when to risk tougher fights for bigger rewards. By blending exploration and deckbuilding, Roguebook delivers a richly layered experience.</p>
