<h1>Across the Obelisk: Cooperative Deckbuilding Mastery</h1>
<p>Across the Obelisk takes the roguelike deckbuilder formula and adds something revolutionary: true 4-player cooperative gameplay. Released by Dreamsite Games, this ambitious title proves that deckbuilding doesn't have to be a solitary experience.</p>
<h2>The Power of Teamwork</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional deckbuilders where you face challenges alone, Across the Obelisk lets you tackle its mysteries with up to three friends. Each player controls a unique hero with distinct cards and abilities, creating opportunities for incredible synergies. The Mage might set up elemental combos while the Warrior tanks damage and the Scout manipulates turn order.</p>
<p>What makes this system brilliant is how it encourages genuine cooperation. You're not just playing alongside others – you're actively planning combos, sharing resources, and coordinating strategies. When your Healer's blessing perfectly sets up your friend's devastating attack, the satisfaction is unmatched.</p>
<h2>Deep Character Progression</h2>
<p>The game features 12 unlockable heroes, each with multiple upgrade paths. Your Magnus can become a fire-wielding destroyer or a versatile elementalist. Your Thuls might focus on healing or transform into a shadow damage dealer. These choices fundamentally change how you play and interact with your team.</p>
<p>Between runs, you'll unlock new cards, perks, and items that permanently enhance your heroes. This meta-progression keeps every run feeling meaningful, even failures contribute to your long-term power growth.</p>

<h2>Strategic Depth</h2>
<p>Combat in Across the Obelisk demands careful planning. Energy management, buff stacking, and timing all matter. The game's corruption system adds risk-reward decisions – powerful cards might curse you, creating long-term consequences for short-term gains.</p>
<p>The node-based map offers meaningful choices. Do you risk the dangerous path for better rewards? Can your team handle an elite fight? These decisions become group discussions, adding a social element rarely seen in the genre.</p>
<h2>Content That Lasts</h2>
<p>With multiple acts, secret bosses, and 16 different endings, Across the Obelisk offers hundreds of hours of content. The madness difficulty levels provide serious challenges for experienced teams, while weekly challenges keep the community engaged.</p>
<p>The game also supports solo play with AI companions, though the experience truly shines in multiplayer. The AI is competent enough for practice runs, but nothing beats the chaos and coordination of human teammates.</p>
<h2>Art and Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The hand-drawn art style creates a unique fantasy atmosphere. Character designs are distinctive and memorable, while spell effects provide satisfying visual feedback. The UI cleanly presents complex information, crucial for a game with this many moving parts.</p>
<p>The soundtrack deserves special mention – orchestral themes that build tension during battles and provide atmospheric exploration music. It's the kind of score that enhances long gaming sessions without becoming repetitive.</p>
<h2>Room for Improvement</h2>
<p>Across the Obelisk isn't without flaws. The learning curve is steep, especially for players new to deckbuilders. Early runs can feel punishing before you understand the synergies. The game could benefit from better tutorials and clearer ability descriptions.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer occasionally suffers from connection issues, and finding random teammates can be hit-or-miss. The game shines brightest when played with friends who communicate actively.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>Across the Obelisk successfully merges cooperative gameplay with roguelike deckbuilding, creating something unique in a crowded genre. While the complexity might intimidate newcomers, those who invest time will discover one of the deepest and most rewarding deckbuilders available.</p>
<p>For groups seeking a challenging cooperative experience or solo players wanting extensive content, Across the Obelisk delivers. It's not just a great deckbuilder – it's proof that the genre still has room for innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Score: 8.5/10</strong></p>
