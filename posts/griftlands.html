            <h2>A Tale of Grit and Negotiation</h2>
            <p><em>Griftlands</em> is a 2021 roguelike deck‑building game with role‑playing elements developed by Klei Entertainment. After an early access period beginning in June 2019, it fully released for Windows, Linux, macOS and consoles in June 2021【424769199772603†L157-L181】. Players choose mercenaries and explore a procedurally generated world where every encounter can lead to combat or negotiation.</p>
            <p>The game features two distinct decks—one for brawling and one for negotiating—each with its own mechanics and synergies【424769199772603†L157-L181】. You acquire and upgrade cards, make choices on a branching map and build relationships with characters who can become allies or enemies. Griftlands’ comic‑book art style and branching narrative make every playthrough unique.</p>
            <h2>Choose Your Approach</h2>
            <p>In Griftlands, words can be as powerful as weapons. Negotiation battles use arguments and resolve as resources, forcing you to think differently than in traditional card games. Coupled with the tactical depth of its combat deck, Griftlands encourages experimentation and offers a fresh take on the genre.</p>
