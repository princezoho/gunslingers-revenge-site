            <h2>Accessibility & Inclusion</h2>
            
            <p>NYC's gaming community increasingly prioritizes accessibility. Many venues offer wheelchair access and accommodate various needs. Groups like "Accessible Gaming New York" specifically focus on ensuring everyone can participate. Most venues welcome service animals and can provide assistance for players with visual or mobility challenges.</p>

            <p>The community has also embraced inclusion initiatives, with many venues hosting LGBTQ+ game nights and women-focused events. These dedicated spaces help newcomers feel welcome while building diverse gaming communities.</p>
