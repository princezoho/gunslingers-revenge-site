            <h2>Creating Memorable Personalities</h2>
            <p>A great Wild West game is defined by its characters. From fearless gunslingers to mysterious drifters, each persona adds depth and flavour to your world. When designing characters, think about their backstory, motivations and unique traits.</p>
            <p>Visual design plays an important role. Use silhouettes and accessories – hats, coats, boots and weapons – to instantly communicate a character’s role. Colours can signal allegiances or hint at personality; muted earth tones evoke rugged frontier life while flashes of bright colour can highlight a character’s flair.</p>
            <p>Don’t forget quirks and flaws. Memorable characters often have idiosyncrasies that make them relatable. Maybe your sharpshooter has a gambling problem or your doctor moonlights as a card cheat. These details enrich the narrative and give players reasons to care.</p>
