            <h2>A Faithful Digital Translation</h2>
            <p><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> brings the decades‑old trading card game into the digital age. Developed by Wizards of the Coast, it entered beta in 2017 and officially released for Windows in 2019, with macOS and mobile versions following in 2020 and 2021【222465101328132†L148-L169】. The game uses the same rules as the physical card game, letting you build decks from a vast library of cards and challenge opponents worldwide.</p>
            <p>Players earn cards through booster packs, achievements or optional microtransactions, and can compete in constructed or limited formats【222465101328132†L171-L176】. New players start with a selection of starter decks and can unlock more as they play. Regular expansions mirror the tabletop releases, keeping the metagame fresh.</p>
            <h2>Why Play Arena?</h2>
            <p>The Arena client offers slick animations, cross‑platform matchmaking and a generous free‑to‑play progression system. It’s a great way to learn Magic’s complex rules and experiment with deck ideas before investing in paper cards. Whether you’re a seasoned Planeswalker or a newcomer, Arena delivers a polished digital dueling experience.</p>
