Briefly discuss the possibility of these type of arrest stops, the campfires and such. Having a
classical RPG with our characters, of being able to navigate, move a character through a town
or a campfire, with just a different few spots. So you don't have to go far to choose things, like
choosing to go to the burn your card station, or choose to upgrade your card station, or to
remove a curse station, or whatever the stations are at that particular rest stop. Each rest stop is
varied about what sort of menu of things you can do are available to you. All rest stops are
created equal, I guess. And as the game progresses, the stakes of the rest stop go up even
more so, for what they can do for you, and what's at stake to lose for getting a bad one. Luck,
here, and charm have played roles here. The deals you get, the combinations you get, and your
ability to... Sorry, charisma, not charms. Charisma. The charisma you have to then improve your
luck, improve your combinations.
